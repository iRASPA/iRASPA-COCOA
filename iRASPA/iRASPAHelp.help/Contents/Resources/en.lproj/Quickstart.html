  <h1>Quick start</h1>
  <p>The project-navgiator has 3 sections: GALLERY, LOCAL PROJECTS, and ICLOUD PUBLIC. The gallery contains some examples to play around with, in "local projects" you can put your own projects with editting capability, and the icloud-part contains cloud-stored databases. The gallery and cloud sections are immutable, but can be dragged and dropped or copy-and-pasted to your "local projects"-section, after which they can be editted for content and appearance.</p>

  <p>You can view and edit your own structures by importing them. The most common formats for structures are CIF-files and PDB-files. The easiest way of importing these types of files is to drag them from the Finder and then drop them in the project-navigator in the "local projects"-section. Alternatively, you can use the menu options "File" and then "Import".</p>
