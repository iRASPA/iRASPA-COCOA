    <h2 class="Name">David Dubbeldam</h2>
    <p>David Dubbeldam received his B.Sc. and Ph.D. degree (with honors) from the University of Amsterdam, in Computer Science and Computational Chemistry, respectively. From 2006 until 2009, he carried out a post-doctoral stay at Northwestern University in the group of Professor Randall Q. Snurr, working on modeling of adsorption and diffusion in flexible metal-organic frameworks. In 2010 he joined the Computational Chemistry Group at the University of Amsterdam as an assistant professor. In 2011, he received the prestigious NWO VIDI grant (1 million euros) for a 5 year period to start up a group working on design and modeling of metal-organic frameworks. He has published over 100 articles in peer-reviewed journals. His Researcher codes are Research-ID B-6753-2014 and ORCID 0000-0002-4382-1509.</p>

    <h2 class="Name">Sofia Calero</h2>    
    <p>Prof. Sofia Calero is head of the Group "Nanostructured materials for technological applications", settled in the Physical Chemistry Division of the Department of Physical, Chemical, and Natural Systems of the University Pablo de Olavide. Her main research interests are in computational approaches for the design of more efficient materials for technological applications. She has authored more than 130 publications and 1 patent which have attracted more than 2700 citations (h-index 30). Her research and training activities have been widely recognized with numerous prizes and academic honours. She is holder of the Spanish RoyalSociety of Chemistry Young Researchers Award (2005) and the Marie Curie Excellence Award (2005) for her work on the development of computational approaches for molecular processes in novel multifunctional nanomaterials. She serves on the boards of directors of the International Adsorption Society (IAS), the Spanish Group of Adsorption (GEA), and the Spanish Society of Catalysis (SECAT) and is a member of the Young Academy of Europe (YAE). She is currently the Principal Investigator of an ERC Consolidator Grant in the discipline of Computational Approaches for Industrial Applications. Her Researcher codes are scopus 7003615005, Research-ID G-3144-2010 and ORCID 0000-0001-9535-057X.</p>
